  <h1>PUPPY BOWL</h1>
  <h3>The year 2005, when Jacksonville, Florida, 
    hosted the New England Patriots and the 
    Philadelphia Eagles for its first Super Bowl, 
    also marked the birth of the Puppy Bowl. 
    It was designed as counterprogramming to 
    the biggest event in American sports, 
    but the actual concept — tiny puppies 
    cavorting on a mini football field — was, 
    like many great ideas, 
    initially suggested in jest, 
    by Animal Planet executives.</h3>
